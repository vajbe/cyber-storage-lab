# Cyber Storage Lab

Cyber Storage Lab is a collection of experiments, utilities, and simulations around **data storage, file systems, and cybersecurity**.  
It is designed as a playground to explore real-world challenges like handling large datasets, hashing, concurrency, secure storage, and fault tolerance.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Explore **file system operations** at scale (millions of files, large files, etc.)
- Experiment with **hashing and integrity checks** (MD5, SHA256, etc.)
- Simulate **concurrent file access and updates**
- Build **resilient handling** for failures (e.g., missing, locked, or deleted files)
- Investigate **cybersecurity practices** in data storage (encryption, secure deletion, access patterns)
